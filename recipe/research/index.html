    <h3>ingredient list:</h3>
    <h4>chicken (or meat of your choice):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons jerk seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>pasta:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb penne pasta</li>
        <li>3 bell peppers, preferably a mix of colors, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>one whole onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 minced garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup jerk seasoning</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of honey</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of all purpose flour</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>preparation</h3>
    <p>pat-dry your chicken and place in a medium bowl with half of the jerk seasoning, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 
        garlic powder, and paprika. Mix/rub seasoning on chicken thoroughly, cover bowl
        with plastic wrap and let sit for 24 hours. Pull out prior to cooking so chicken
        can become room temperature.</p>
    
    <h3>cooking</h3>
    <h4>step 1</h4>
    <p>In a pan or skillet, add one tablespoon of olive oil (from chicken preparation)
        and place on stove on medium to high heat. Once hot, place chicken on pan and cook 
        until browned on one side and slightly brown on the other. Add in sliced onions and 
        peppers and finish cooking chicken through until browned on both sides. Set chicken 
        and veggies aside to cool. 
    </p>
    <h4>step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Begin cooking pasta: add water to a large pot and bring to boil, follow cooking
        instructions on box. Put the pot/skillet used to cook the chicken on the stove 
        on medium-low heat. Once heated, add butter and minced garlic to pan. (Don't 
        forget to check pasta!)
    </p>
    <h4>step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Once garlic is golden brown, add heavy cream to the pot/skillet and bring to a simmer.
    </p>
    <h4>step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Once pasta is finished, drain and set aside.
    </p>
    <h4>step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Once the cream has reached a simmer, add in 1 teaspoon of all purpose flour and 
        parmesan. Simmer and lightly stir until cheese and flour are blended, then add 
        remaining jerk seasoning and honey and stir until sauce is blended. If necessary, 
        add more cheese/cream for thickness/loosness and/or more seasoning for taste.
    </p>
    <h4>step 6</h4>
    <p>
        Once sauce is to liking, add pasta to pot and stir, then slice chicken and add to 
        pasta with veggies and stir.
    </p>
    <h4>step 7</h4>
    <p>
        serve and enjoy!

                : This site is a great example of authentic rasta pasta cooked by a Jamaican! 
                It is also very clear and concise which makes it less overwhelming, especially 
                for someone who could be new to cooking.

                : This site does a great job of going in detail and even providing a bit of 
                cultural background on the dish which I greatly appreciated as a Jamaican. 
                The site also included lots of pictures throughout the process which even 
                I myself found really helpful.

                : This site did a great job of explaining some background but what I found 
                really unique was all the possible questions an individual may have that 
                the author answered before you can reach the recipe (however there was a 
                "jump to recipe") option which I though was also cool. The site alos provided 
                prep and storage techniques which is really helpful!
