            <h1 id="t1">Bandwidth Types</h1>
            <h3>Ka Band</h3>
            <p>
                Ka Band, (pronounced as either "kay-ay band" or "ka band") is a portion of the microwave part of 
                the electromagnetic spectrum defined as frequencies in the range 26.5–40 gigahertz (GHz), i.e. wavelengths from slightly over 
                one centimeter down to 7.5 millimeters. The band is called Ka, short for "K-above" because it is the upper part of the 
                original NATO K band, which was split into three bands because of the presence of the atmospheric water vapor resonance peak 
                at 22.24 GHz (1.35 cm), which made the center unusable for long range transmission. The 30/20 GHz band is used in communications 
                satellite uplinks in either the 27.5 GHz and 31 GHz bands, and high-resolution, close-range targeting radars aboard military 
                airplanes. Some frequencies in this radio band are used for vehicle speed detection by law enforcement. The Kepler Mission 
                used this frequency range to downlink the scientific data collected by the space telescope. The designation "Ka-band" is from 
                Kurz-above, which stems from the German word kurz meaning "short". In satellite communications, the Ka band allows higher bandwidth 
                communication.
            </p>
            <h3>X Band</h3>
            <p>
                The X band is the designation for a band of frequencies in the microwave radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In some 
                cases, such as in communication engineering, the frequency range of the X band is rather indefinitely set at approximately 
                7.0–11.2 GHz.[citation needed] In radar engineering, the frequency range is specified by the Institute of Electrical and 
                Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as 8.0–12.0 GHz. The X band is used for radar, satellite communication, and wireless computer networks.
            </p>
            <h1>Ka Band VS. X Band</h1>
            <p>
                As we see, Ka Band is more complex than both X and K bands. It is comprised of radar waves between 27.0 GHz and 40.0 GHz. However, 
                X Band performs better under inclement weather which may or may not be more useful for space technology depending on the circumstances. 
                band was adopted a couple of decades ago as a high-performance upgrade from X Band radar. Because of its higher frequency, it is harder 
                to detect from a long-distance than the X Band. Because of these points amongst others, Ka Band is the preferred radar technology and 
                X band isn't as widely used anymore.
            </p>
            <h1>Applications</h1>
            <p>
                The Ka-band frequency allows the use of smaller antennas. Ka-band frequency can be used in high-resolution, close-range targeting 
                radars, military aircraft, space telescopes, commercial, wireless point-point microwave communication systems, vehicle speed detection 
                systems, and satellite communications. 
            </p>
            <p>
                X-band frequencies are utilized for secure communications. The frequencies employed in naval, government, and defense applications are 
                typically X-band frequencies. In the navy, the tracking of surface targets is done using X-band radars. For secure internet access for 
                crew and other operations, X-band frequencies are often used in the military.
