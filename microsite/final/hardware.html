                    An antenna is an array of conductors (elements),  
                    electrically connected to the receiver or transmitter. Antennas can be designed to transmit and receive radio waves in all horizontal directions 
                    equally (omnidirectional antennas), or preferentially in a particular direction (directional, or high-gain, or “beam” antennas). An antenna may 
                    include components not connected to the transmitter, parabolic reflectors, horns, or parasitic elements, which serve to direct the radio waves 
                    into a beam or other desired radiation pattern. Strong directivity and good efficiency when transmitting are hard to achieve with antennas with 
                    dimensions that are much smaller than a half wavelength.

                    In radio engineering, an antenna or aerial is the interface between radio waves propagating through space and electric currents moving in metal 
                    conductors, used with a transmitter or receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current to the antenna's terminals, 
                    and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power 
                    of a radio wave in order to produce an electric current at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified. Antennas are essential 
                    components of all radio equipment.
                </p>
                <h1>Antenna Gain</h1>
                <p>
                    In electromagnetics, an antenna's gain is a key performance parameter which combines the antenna’s directivity and radiation efficiency. The term 
                    power gain has been deprecated by IEEE. In a transmitting antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts input power into radio waves 
                    headed in a specified direction. In a receiving antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts radio waves arriving from a specified 
                    direction into electrical power. When no direction is specified, gain is understood to refer to the peak value of the gain, the gain in the direction 
                    of the antenna's main lobe. A plot of the gain as a function of direction is called the antenna pattern or radiation pattern. It is not to be confused 
                    with directivity, which does not take an antenna's radiation efficiency into account.
                </p>

                    <img id="gain-img" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Antenna_directive_gain_diagram.svg/1200px-Antenna_directive_gain_diagram.svg.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <p id="gain-img-text-container">
                    Gain or 'absolute gain' is defined as "The ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction to the radiation intensity that would 
                    be produced if the power accepted by the antenna were isotropically radiated". Usually this ratio is expressed in decibels with respect 
                    to an isotropic radiator (dBi). An alternative definition compares the received power to the power received by a lossless half-wave dipole 
                    antenna, in which case the units are written as dBd.
                </p>
                <p id="post-image-p">
                    Since a lossless dipole antenna has a gain of 2.15 dBi, the relation between these units is Gain(dBd) ≈ Gain(dBi) - 2.15. For a given frequency, 
                    the antenna's effective area is proportional to the gain. An antenna's effective length is proportional to the square root of the antenna's gain 
                    for a particular frequency and radiation resistance. Due to reciprocity, the gain of any antenna when receiving is equal to its gain when transmitting.
                </p>
                <h1>High Gain</h1>
                <p>
                    High-gain antennas are focused antennas with narrow radio beams, allowing for precise targeting of radio signals. This antenna is used in 
                    space missions as well as in flat, open areas where the geography won’t disrupt radio waves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    High-gain antennas transmit more power to the receiver, increasing the strength of the signal it receives. As a result of their reciprocity, 
                    high-gain antennas can also make transmitted signals 100 times stronger by capturing more energy when used in receiving antenna. As a result 
                    of their directivity, directional antennas send fewer signals from a direction other than the main beam. This property reduces interference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    High-gain antennas can also be produced from parabolic antennas, phased arrays and yagi antennas. Antenna gains are defined with respect to 
                    hypothetical antennas that radiate equally in all directions – the isotropic radiator. This gain can be measured in decibels (dBi) or, in 
                    certain cases, decibels compared to the maximum intensity of the direction of half-wave dipoles (dBd).
                </p>
                <h1>Low Gain</h1>
                <p>
                    A small spacecraft antenna that provides a low amplification of radio frequency signals. An LGA is capable of transmitting and receiving 
                    in almost any direction, and does not require highly accurate pointing. Sometimes an LGA is mounted above the spacecraft's high-gain antenna 
                    (HGA), as on Galileo and Cassini. LGAs can be used with space probes to the nearer planets, as with Magellan investigating Venus, but probes 
                    traveling further, such as the Voyager probes, must use high-gain antennae.

                    An amplifier, electronic amplifier or (informally) amp is an electronic device that can increase the magnitude of a signal (a time-varying 
                    voltage or current). A power amplifier is similarly used to deliver output power (AF or RF), controlled by an input signal. It is a two-port 
                    electronic circuit that uses electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude (magnitude of the voltage or current) of a signal 
                    applied to its input terminals, producing a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output. The amount of amplification provided by 
                    an amplifier is measured by its gain: the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input. An amplifier is a circuit that has a power 
                    gain greater than one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An amplifier can either be a separate piece of equipment or an electrical circuit contained within another device. Amplification is 
                    fundamental to modern electronics, and amplifiers are widely used in almost all electronic equipment. Amplifiers can be categorized in 
                    different ways. One is by the frequency of the electronic signal being amplified. For example, audio amplifiers amplify signals in the 
                    audio (sound) range of less than 20 kHz, RF amplifiers amplify frequencies in the radio frequency range between 20 kHz and 300 GHz, and 
                    servo amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers may work with very low frequencies down to direct current. Amplifiers can also be 
                    categorized by their physical placement in the signal chain; a preamplifier may precede other signal processing stages, for example. 
                    The first practical electrical device which could amplify was the triode vacuum tube, invented in 1906 by Lee De Forest, which led to 
                    the first amplifiers around 1912. Today most amplifiers use transistors.

                    Amplification means increasing the amplitude (voltage or current) of a time-varying signal by a given factor, as shown here. The graph 
                    shows the input v_i(t) (blue) and output voltage v_o(t) (red) of an ideal linear amplifier with an arbitrary signal applied as input. 
                    In this example the amplifier has a voltage gain of 3; that is at any instant v_o(t) = 3v_i(t).
