    <ol>
        <li>My name is Sharyliz and I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science with
            minors in Psychology and Human-Computer Interation

            I'm from New Jersey and I'm taking this course because I'm really interested in the user-design experience as well as how it can
            be improved (plus it was the most interesting option to fulfill my HCI requirements).

            As a computer science major I have a bit of background in html and css. I was also a TA for a Web Development course
            for a year.

            I hope to learn web design fundamentals and how small decision can greatly impact the user's experience.

            I think designing for the screen will be different from designing for paper as technology has become an integral part of
            every day life for many people, and thus there are specific cultures, habits, and tendencies of individuals who use
            technology often. For example, when desiging for a screen, although taking into consideration color and text size may be the same,
            the ability to scroll to content not yet seen compared to being able to see a piece of paper overall is something that differs and
            should be taken into consideration as well.

            <a href="https://www.thecheesecakefactory.com">Here's a website with effective design.</a> I consider this site's
            design effective because not only is it eye-catching and not overwhelming, but the content is very organized and follows/is designed to accomodate typical
            user habits (menu bar at the top, larger information at forfront, utilizing "z" style user-scanning when the user
            scrolls).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com">Here's a website I think exemplifies effective communication.</a> As you can see, the 
            content on the home page is clear and simply communicated with images that directly correlate to what the site wants to
            communicate (that you can buy/learn more about these items). If you delve deeper to learn more about products, you get 
            clear and interactive explanations on what you're looking for.

        <li>
            <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Here's a website I think works well.</a> This streaming platform works really well
            for its users. Users are met with a home screen that shows an array of things they can watch along with items tailored to them
            based on past interest/watched content. I think this site works really well as the design is straightforward and accomplished a 
            goal for the user is not difficult.
