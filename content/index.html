    <h3>ingredient list:</h3>

    <h4>chicken (or meat of your choice):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A large pan or skillet</li>
        <li>A medium sized bowl</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons jerk seasoning</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper, preferably a gradient of 2+ colors, sliced with a thickness of your liking</li>
        <li>1/2 a whole onion, cut into strips with a thickness of your liking</li>
        <li>1 large boneless skinless chicken breast, diced</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>pasta:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>large deep pot (able to fit at least 5 cups of water)</li>
        <li>1 lb of penne rigate pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>white sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large saute pan, at least 2 inches in depth, or the same pan/skillet the chicken is prepared in</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 minced garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of butter (or similar alternative of choice)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream (or similar alternative of choice)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 oz grated parmesan</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoon jerk seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of honey</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>preparation</h3>
    <p>after cleaning, pat-dry your chicken and place in a medium bowl with half of the jerk seasoning, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 
        garlic powder, italian seasoning, and paprika. Mix/rub seasoning on chicken thoroughly, cover bowl
        with plastic wrap and let sit for 24 hours. Pull out prior to cooking so chicken
        can become room temperature.</p>
    
    <h3>cooking</h3>
    <h4>step 1</h4>
    <p>In a pan or skillet, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil (from chicken preparation)
        and place on stove on medium to high heat. Once hot, place chicken on pan and cook 
        until browned on all sides. Set aside to cool.
    </p>
    <h4>step 2</h4>
    <p>
        To the same pan the chicken was made in, add in sliced onions and peppers and cook 
        until slightly soft (or to your liking). Set aside with cooked chicken.
    </p>
    <h4>step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Begin cooking pasta: add water to a large pot and bring to boil, follow cooking
        instructions on box. Put pan/skillet dedicated for the white pasta sauce on the stove 
        on medium-low heat. Once heated, add butter and minced garlic to pan. <strong>Note: Don't 
        forget to check pasta!</strong> 
    </p>
    <h4>step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Once garlic is golden brown, add heavy cream to the pan/skillet and bring to a simmer.
    </p>
    <h4>step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Once pasta is finished, drain and set aside.
    </p>
    <h4>step 6</h4>
    <p>
        Once the cream has reached a simmer, add in 1 teaspoon of all purpose flour and 
        parmesan. Simmer and lightly stir until cheese and flour are blended, then add 
        remaining jerk seasoning and honey and stir until sauce is blended. If necessary, 
        add more cheese/cream for thickness/loosness and/or more seasoning for taste.
    </p>
    <h4>step 7</h4>
    <p>
        Once sauce is to liking, add chicken and veggies, stir, then add pasta to pot, stir, and taste. 
        If necessary, add more cream, cheese, and/or seasoning.
    </p>
    <h4>step 8</h4>
    <p>
        serve and enjoy!

                : This site is a great example of authentic rasta pasta cooked by a Jamaican! 
                It is also very clear and concise which makes it less overwhelming, especially 
                for someone who could be new to cooking.

                : This site does a great job of going in detail and even providing a bit of 
                cultural background on the dish which I greatly appreciated as a Jamaican. 
                The site also included lots of pictures throughout the process which even 
                I myself found really helpful.

                : This site did a great job of explaining some background but what I found 
                really unique was all the possible questions an individual may have that 
                the author answered before you can reach the recipe (however there was a 
                "jump to recipe") option which I though was also cool. The site alos provided 
                prep and storage techniques which is really helpful!
